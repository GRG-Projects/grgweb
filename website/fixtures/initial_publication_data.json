Many methods have been developed to use dMRI data to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiber bundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different parts of the brain. Dipy gathers implementations of many different methods in dMRI, including:  ...",

Here we propose an efficient implementation based on multithreaded processing and pre-computed lookup tables that enable large scale experiments. We demonstrate its potential in crossing-preserving enhancement of ODF/FOD fields where the aim is to enhance the alignment of elongated structures such that crossings are maintained.",
